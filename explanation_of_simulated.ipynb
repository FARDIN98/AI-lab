        "## The N-Queen problem is a classic problem in which N queens are to be placed on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other (i.e., no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal).\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a broad explanation of the code:\n",
        "\n",
        "The Queen class is defined to represent the chessboard and the placement of queens. It has methods to add queens randomly to the board and get neighboring positions of a cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "The conflict function is used to check if there's a conflict between two queens in terms of their row, column, or diagonal positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The get_conflict function calculates the number of conflicts a queen has with other queens on the chessboard.\n",
        "\n",
        "The calc_cost function computes the total cost of conflicts and identifies the queen with the maximum conflicts.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal_test function checks if the current state is the goal state (i.e., no conflicts between queens).\n",
        "\n",
        "The move_queen function randomly moves a queen to a neighboring cell on the chessboard.\n",
        "\n",
        "The simulated_annealing function performs the Simulated Annealing algorithm to find a solution for the N-Queen problem. It starts with an initial temperature and iteratively decreases the temperature to explore the solution space.\n",
        "\n",
        "The queen object is created with a 4x4 chessboard and initial queen placements.\n",
        "\n",
        "The simulated_annealing function is called to find a solution by iteratively moving queens to neighboring positions while considering the temperature and cost difference.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the final state of the queens and the maximum number of conflicts are printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the code uses Simulated Annealing to find a solution to the N-Queen problem by iteratively exploring different configurations of queens on the chessboard and accepting moves that reduce conflicts while considering the temperature. The algorithm is probabilistic, and it aims to find a near-optimal solution to the problem.**bold text**"
